A variety of small Open Source projects for ColdFusion MX from Sean Corfield (An Architect's View).

Currently this project contains:
  * CFEclipseFacade - a cfcUnit-compatible version of the CFC required by the CFUnit plugin
  * Closures for CFMX - inspired by closures in a variety of languages
  * Concurrency for CFMX - inspired by Java 5's concurrency package
  * Edmund - Event-based programming for ColdFusion
  * IRCBot Event Gateway - this is a CFMX Event Gateway that acts as a channel bot on IRC
  * Scripting - PHP and Ruby execution enabled via custom tags

Other projects will be added over time.
